This project focuses on optimizing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure through data analysis and linear programming. It aims to improve scheduling, reduce congestion, and guide the expansion of charging stations by analyzing charging patterns and station utilization. The goal is to provide actionable insights for better planning and management of EV charging networks to accommodate the increasing demand for electric vehicles.
